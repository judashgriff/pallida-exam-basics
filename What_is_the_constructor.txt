What is the constructor? When it is used?


A constructor is a function of a class which is automatically started instantly when the class is initialised. 
It is called __init__ because it initialises first.

For example:

class House:
    def __init__(self):
        self.floors = 3
        self.window_per_floor = 6

    def count_windows(self):
        windows_total = self.floors * self.window_per_floor
        print(windows_total)


house = House()
house.count_windows()

In the example above 
        
        def __init__(self):
        self.floors = 3
        self.window_per_floor = 6

                        is the constructor. This will always run first when the House class is called. 

The "count_windows" method will only run when it is specificly called like above and here in line 34, 
so it is not part of the constructor:

        house = House()
        house.count_windows()

Constuctors are mostly used when we want to provide universal attributes to a class, which are automatically 
inherited to a child class as well, or overwriting their parent classes values from their constructor.
