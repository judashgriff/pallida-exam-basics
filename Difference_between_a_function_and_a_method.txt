Methods and functions are pretty much the same. 

Functions only work when called. 

Methods are functions which are object oriented as well. That means that they are in a class.
For example:

class House:
    def __init__(self):
        self.floors = 3
        self.window_per_floor = 6

    def count_windows(self):
        windows_total = self.floors * self.window_per_floor
        print(windows_total)


def count_trees_aruond_the_house():
    if desert = True:
        print("There are no trees around this house. It's in the desert!")

desert = True

count_trees_aruond_the_house()

house = House()
house.count_windows()


In the example above "count_windows" is a method of the House class, 
while "count_trees_aruond_the_house" is an independent function.
